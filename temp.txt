  title: Summer Pizza
  description:
    This summer pizza is loaded with fresh veggies, light on the cheese,
    and is made on the grill. The butter glaze makes a nice finish,
    but you can skip it if you like.
  
  div.container:
    ingredients:
      <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup pesto</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup shredded quesadilla cheese</li>
      <li>10 thin slices zucchini</li>
      <li>10 thin slices summer squash</li>
      <li>2 mini bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 thin slice red onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 strip cooked bacon, chopped</li>
      <li>
        <strong>OPTIONAL:</strong>1 tablespoon butter + 1 teaspoon Brazilian steak
        seasoning, or any seasoning you like
      </li>
    steps:
      <li>
        Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15
        minutes. Shape pizza dough into a circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create
        areas of direct and indirect heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat.
        Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely
        cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use tongs to flip pizza dough over; move to the indirect heat.
        Brush dough with pesto. Sprinkle with cheese. Scatter on
        zucchini, summer squash, bell pepper, red onion, and bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.
        Carefully remove pizza from the grill.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Brush crust edges with butter glaze and place pizza
        under the oven broiler, until golden.
