        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This summer pizza is loaded with fresh veggies, light on the cheese, 
            and is made on the grill. The butter glaze makes a nice finish, 
            but you can skip it if you like.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup pesto</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup shredded quesadilla cheese</li>

            <li>10 thin slices summer squash</li>
            <li>2 mini bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 thin slice red onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 strip cooked bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>
                <strong>OPTIONAL:</strong>1 tablespoon butter + 1 teaspoon Brazilian steak 
                seasoning, or any seasoning you like
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 
                minutes. Shape pizza dough into a circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create 
                areas of direct and indirect heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat. 
                Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely 
                cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use tongs to flip pizza dough over; move to the indirect heat. 
                Brush dough with pesto. Sprinkle with cheese. Scatter on 
                zucchini, summer squash, bell pepper, red onion, and bacon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. 
                Carefully remove pizza from the grill.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Brush crust edges with butter glaze and place pizza 
                under the oven broiler, until golden.
            </li>
        </ol>
